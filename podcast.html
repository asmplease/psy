                                        <span class="first-letter">Sasha Singh</span> has created a series of podcasts
                                        with professional athletes on how they have been able to stay mentally and
                                        physically
                                        motivated during these challenging times. While the COVID-19 pandemic has led
                                        the world to a standstill, these athletes
                                        give you an insight on how they are constantly working to ensure that their
                                        performance isn't impacted.

                                        Mental health is an extremely important aspect of athletic performance. Each
                                        sport requires a certain level of
                                        commitment and while this pandemic has affected all athletes, the key to
                                        ensuring that your performance is not affected
                                        is to remain mentally and emotionally motivated. Athletes such as Jeev Milkha
                                        Singh a professional golfer and Fouaad
                                        Mirza an Asian Games silver medalist in equestrian provide essential information
                                        on how to best prepare yourself to
                                        continue performing in peak condition when the world returns to normalcy.

                            <p></p>

                            <p> During this pandemic, I stayed home and followed social distancing all my</p>

                            <p> Fitness and yoga exercises were done in my home, I started to reduce my</p>

                            <p> Caloric intake.</p>

                            <p></p>

                            <p>2. How has the coronavirus pandemic affected mental health in athletes? How have you been able to remain mentally and emotionally motivated?</p>

                            <p></p>

                            <p>During these bad times my routine training has been affected and performance has naturally come down and it has affected me mentally and I haven&rsquo;t trained to my level of satisfaction, emotionally I know the whole world is going through the same troubles I am facing and I am hoping for the best.</p>

                            <p></p>

                            <p>3. How has the delay in the Olympic games effected your preparation? How do you think this will impact your performance?</p>

                            <p></p>

                            <p>I am very disappointed that the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics has been postponed due to the corona virus outbreak I was eagerly waiting for the Tokyo Paralympics games and I wanted to show my best performance to the world, Unfortunately as the games were postponed my training schedule was disturbed and keeping this strict food diet and training for one more year is a challenge. This will affect my performance undoubtedly and I am mentally demotivated for this Paralympics.</p>

                            <p></p>

                            <p>4. Was there a time in your career when you felt highly stressed and how did you deal with it?</p>

                            <p></p>

                            <p>In my entire career the most stressful time was in 2017 during my world Para athletics championship London as I was injured badly.</p>

                            <p>My coach Satyanarayana stood by me all the way during this recovery and he continuously motivated me by telling me that I am still young and I have immense potential ahead of me. This was my only way to deal with that stressful time. Later on in 2018 I won the medal in Para-Asian games in Jakarta.</p>

                            <p></p>

                            <p>5. How much of performance can be linked to an athlete&rsquo;s mental state?</p>

                            <p></p>

                            <p>Mental state and performance are linked to each other. Mental state is one of the key for successful performance. Positive attitude and positive thoughts are very much required for successful performance.</p>

                            <p></p>

                            <p>6. What advice would you give young athletes on how they should keep themselves mentally and physically motivated?</p>

                            <p></p>

                            <p>Respecting the medal winners and coaches is one of the best advices I have to give to young athletes. Reading biographies and watching the documentaries about the successful sports men and the struggles they went through personally and professionally is very important as the athletes will gain new insight of this sports world where anything is possible with hard work and right guidance.</p>
